Captain’s Log: Day 2: Hour 3: 

    What are we if not creatures of passion? Are we not filled with the will to persevere, against all odds in life, by the mere prospect of reaching our smallest goals? 
    During this long night these seem to be the only questions capable of even mildly satiating my mind’s growing hunger for an answer to the ultimate question...why? 
    Why do we persist all these hours to see our projects to completion? Some say that the longer one resists the seduction of slumber, 
    the more open they are to the true perception of life. I witness this truth in the present as I tell you our story now. None of us are builders, we aren’t “hackers”,
    we aren’t even thinkers. We are creators. We command forces of nature to instill artificial life into interconnected pieces of metal.
    When we open our eyes to the world around us we see the endless chains of mountains, we feel the crashing waves of the vast oceans, 
    and we hear the beating hearts of every earthly creature. We bare witness to such majesty and we attribute it all to a great designer, 
    a creator, because truly, we aspire to birth such wonder ourselves. And therefore I ask you, are we not young Gods ourselves? 
    We watch and observe in awe even at the creations which we ourselves have bestowed upon this planet, marveling in our own ingenuity and promise. 
    And after taking in all that our senses can comprehend, after facing every struggle of life, we still hold onto that desire we are born with, 
    the fire in our hearts that tells us someday, we will find the light...through creation...through perseverance...through belief in ourselves and eachother. 
    Life is our only true test, so let me lend you my hand now, so that we may make it through and find that hopeful light, together.
